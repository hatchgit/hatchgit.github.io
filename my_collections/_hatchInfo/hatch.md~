### Origins

Hatch germinated from the personal experience of one person, and grew through its resonance with more of us, drawing us to heed its call. It was a heart-stirring story from Victor, which eventually drove him to start Hatch.

Here's Victor's story:
> I served in a fire station during national service, where I was placed in charge of 30 firefighters. Day in and out, my team responded to numerous time-sensitive and often life-threatening fire and rescue emergencies. Everyone saw a meaning in what they are doing, and a couple of my teammates were certain that they wanted to pursue a full-time career with the force. I saw the passion and drive that my men had for the line of work.
>
>Yet, passion was never enough. The overemphasis on paper qualifications downplayed the years of experience they had with the force. My superiors and I wrote letters of recommendations for these firefighters but none of them secured positions with the force. 
>
> The education landscape has changed drastically, but our perception hasnâ€™t. We continue to rank qualifications on a vertical hierarchy, and we continue to adopt them even when it is absurd. So while the HR officers were busy recruiting at road shows, we had proven firefighters who could not stay on because of what society had perceived their qualifications to mean. 

Meritocracy lies at the core of Singapore. Yet, within a key public agency, Victor ran up against an overly rigid system that seemed to fly in the face of this principle.

This experience was more than a contradiction; it was an injustice.

### The scale of it

Looking outward, we saw that this was not confined to one organization. No, indeed not; for in the process of growing into the country we are today, we have baked it into our very society &mdash; our perceptions, and the structures we have built.

The paper chase. Grade inflation. Graduate underemployment. The stigma of ITEs. Difficulty facing foreign competition. These are symptomatic of a fundamental problem: a society gripped by a misshapen meritocracy. In some ways, we are not doing nearly that badly; graduate underemployment is a lot lower than in countries like Taiwan, for example. But, slowly, surely, the problem is growing. 

Given more time, meritocracy will turn into monstrosity.

If it hasn't already.

### Left in the wake

This problem belongs to the whole of society. But while each person fends for himself, have we paused to consider who's being left behind?

While Singapore has largely maintained a level playing field in education, opportunities in other aspects of career preparation, such as internships and career advice, are not readily accessible to youths of lower socio-economic groups. In turn, these youths face limited career choices and lack the practical knowledge to pursue personal growth.

This occurs in a situation where the path to suitable employment can be especially challenging even for those who are motivated and driven. Existing outreach programs provide support through social-work intervention which engage youths to help them stay crime-free and develop as resilient individuals. However, a large group of them are still unable to pursue a meaningful career and achieve financial security after going through these programs. This is a gap which Hatch aims to address.

Job options are predominantly vocational within work placement programs. It is difficult to achieve financial security through these jobs and many youths desire and deserve a more meaningful career. 

Youth-at-risk are disadvantaged by the lack of formal qualifications. They lack career guidance and the opportunity to enrol into training programs that address their lack of formal education or qualifications.

In turn, these youths face limited career choices and lack the practical knowledge to pursue personal growth. 

Existing programmes do not address the exclusion of our disadvantaged youths from a large swathe of attractive and viable career options. For work placement programs such as YMCA Project Bridge, employment options provided for the youths are within what we conventionally constitute as vocational. But these are still options that the youths, on their own, already have access to. As a result, at-risk youths are still limited from pursuing other career pathways.


Pursuing a fulfilling career is tough for all of us, with the challenge greater for some than others. Our society's way of measuring ability makes it almost impossible for at-risk youths to explore and pursue areas they are passionate it.


Our personal interactions with them and their youth workers is that the path to suitable employment can be especially challenging even for those who are motivated and driven. Existing outreach programs provide support through social-work intervention which engages youths to help them stay crime-free and develop as resilient individuals. However, a large group of them are still unable to pursue a meaningful career and achieve financial security after going through these programs. This is a gap which Hatch aims to address.
