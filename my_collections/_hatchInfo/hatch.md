Fireman story

### Seeing the bigger picture

Looking outward, we realized this was not confined to one organization; rather, it is Singapore-wide, and whole-of-society in nature.

While Singapore has largely maintained a level playing field in education, opportunities in other aspects of career preparation, such as internships and career advice, are not readily accessible to youths of lower socio-economic groups. In turn, these youths face limited career choices and lack the practical knowledge to pursue personal growth.

This occurs in a situation where the path to suitable employment can be especially challenging even for those who are motivated and driven. Existing outreach programs provide support through social-work intervention which engage youths to help them stay crime-free and develop as resilient individuals. However, a large group of them are still unable to pursue a meaningful career and achieve financial security after going through these programs. This is a gap which Hatch aims to address.

Job options are predominantly vocational within work placement programs. It is difficult to achieve financial security through these jobs and many youths desire and deserve a more meaningful career. 

Youth-at-risk are disadvantaged by the lack of formal qualifications. They lack career guidance and the opportunity to enrol into training programs that address their lack of formal education or qualifications.
