#### About training course
<br />
##### Who are the trainers?
 - The trainers are professional UI/UX designers from a local UX agency called [User Experience Researchers](https://www.user.com.sg/).

##### What is the UI/UX web design program exactly?
 - The month-long training program will cover basic UI/UX theory and concepts, with a greater focus on application and hands-on work, especially in the translation of a design idea into a tangible product. This will be through learning to use wireframing tools and software suites to create mock-ups and wireframes.

##### What is UI/UX specifically?
 - UI/UX stands for User Interface/User Experience. It is about designing products, usually web pages and apps, to make them user-friendly. It is important because we are becoming increasingly reliant on digital products like apps and websites in our daily life, and good UI/UX makes the difference between being frustrated by a hard-to-use app and having a seamless experience with the app doing everything perfectly.
 - The iPhone is a typical example of a product with a good UI/UX, as it is highly intuitive and aesthetically pleasing, which was one of its biggest selling points. Examples of UI/UX considerations include how information is organized and presented to the user, and how to guide the user's attention so that the app feels natural to use.
 - Good UI/UX takes a lot of skill and effort to understand what the user needs from the product, and to translate that into an effective design. However, it is a skill that can be learnt and developed over time with conscientious effort.

##### How much will participants be paid during job placement?
 - The pay will be $1,000 monthly.

#### Participant requirements
<br />
##### What is a suitable age range for participating youth?
 - As the program comprises both the training and internship, the youth should be at a work-ready age. 18-25 would be optimal.
