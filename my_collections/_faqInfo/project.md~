### What we do

Hatch provides youths/YARs with effective training and job matching services by working closely with our industry partners. 


### Focus areas

Hatch is capitalizing on recent developments in the digital sector because:
- there is a steady growth in demand for skilled tech workers providing good career prospects, as validated by professionals and hiring managers in the sector
- have with us several partner companies who have agreed to hire these youths upon completion of our training program
- a sizeable portion of youths have interest in joining tech-related sectors even though they may not know how they do so, as validated by program coordinators and youth workers


#### Specific sectors: UI/UX and Web Design

UI focuses on the interactivity and presentation of a product while UX focuses on optimising a product for pleasant and efficient use.

The jobs in these areas are less narrowly technical and does not require high levels of  programming competency or being fluent in various programming languages. They require a more generalist skill set which is easier to pick up, and is complemented by some technical knowledge that is applied to the development of technical products. Thus, the barriers to entry into these jobs are relatively low and the skills required are also transferable and have lasting value.


### How it'll work

Hatch will be investing in developing participants through the management and facilitation of the Hatch programme. Our pilot programme is open to youths/YARs who are driven and possess a strong interest in the IT or design industry. All costs for the pilot will be paid for through our funding with NYC, so there is no cost incurred on the youth.

Thereafter, Hatch will work closely with our partner employers/companies/SMEs/start-ups to see if there are any gaps we need to address.

Through our customised training programme for the youths/YARs jointly designed by our partner companies and trainers, we ensure that they receive quality training that meets the needs and demands of the industry that they are entering. Companies are ensured that the youths will be equipped with skills that they expect of in their employees.

Our pool of trained and motivated youths can also serve as a source of sustainability for companies. By having the opportunity to closely interact with youths that they may potentially become long term employees, employers can find the right fit for various roles in their companies.

4. What is UI/UX specifically?
    - UI/UX stands for User Interface/User Experience. It is about designing products, usually web pages and apps, to make them user-friendly. It is important because we are becoming increasingly reliant on digital products like apps and websites in our daily life, and good UI/UX makes the difference between being frustrated by a hard-to-use app and having a seamless experience with the app doing everything perfectly.
    - The iPhone is a typical example of a product with a good UI/UX, as it is highly intuitive and aesthetically pleasing, which was one of its biggest selling points. Examples of UI/UX considerations include how information is organized and presented to the user, and how to guide the user's attention so that the app feels natural to use.
