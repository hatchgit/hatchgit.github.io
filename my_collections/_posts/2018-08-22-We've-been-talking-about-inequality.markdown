Education was touted as the great social leveller. Alongside education, employment and societal integration are just as crucial. Today, however, we'd like to weave a small snapshot of our state by drawing on the stories of 3 notable individuals. Their stories point out important flaws in our society, and in our systems.

These individuals are, namely:
- Singaporean potter [Mr Kim Whye Kee](https://mothership.sg/2018/07/kim-whye-kee-potter-interview/)
- Private tutor and mentor, [Mr Sunny Swee](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ex-convict-helps-others-stay-out-of-trouble)
- Community volunteer [Mr Patrick Chan](http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/if-you-build-it-well-they-will-come?nopaging=1)

Sometimes, just three persons’ stories are enough to express, typify our personal experiences in society, regardless of our background. So, what do their stories tell us about ourselves?

### 1. We've accepted it: the grades we obtain as students are for determining our future as persons.
*This is the fault, not of any individual, but of our society at large.*

>There was never enough money at home because of his father's gambling habit so Mr Swee started working part-time in a fast-food joint when he was 14.
>
>"I worked four or five days a week, from 5pm to 11 pm after school. On weekends, I worked 12 hours. I was always sleeping in class," says the former school prefect.
>
>Three months before his O levels, he quit to concentrate on his exams. But by then, it was too late.
>
>He failed.
>
>Overwhelmed by a sense of hopelessness, he started mixing with members of a gang he met at a games arcade in Bukit Timah. They would hang out in coffee shops and drinking places, spoiling for trouble.
>
> #### "Since I could not make something of my studies, I might as well do something completely opposite," he says sheepishly.



### 2. We still need more spaces for people to be as they are, not as we wish they were.
*We need more ways that people can give of themselves for the benefit of society, lest less noble characters yoke and harness their ability.*
>
>Kim and his friends were recruited by the headmen of 2-4 when they joined a lion dance troupe together. He was in Secondary 3 at the time, and it was 1996 — the year people started losing their jobs as the world slipped into the 1997 economic crisis — and so youth were neglected, their requests for money went ignored, and increasingly took matters into their own hands.
>
>“So the gang have money, we have friends, come and join us. So once you start to recruit they all will come. Like all of a sudden, yeah...
> #### you open up a space for all of them to come.

### 3. We are such stuff as dreams are made on, but our young are too tired to dream.
*Their dreams, fast disappearing, are stowed into an ever-shrinking margin.*

>...gangsterism is one that youth turn to as an alternative to a bleak life in what can be quite an unforgiving Singapore.
>
>Especially when trapped in the viciously tough cycle of low-income/troubled family → weak academic performance → ITE → low income work/jobs.
>
>“… when we were in secondary school, and streamed to Normal (Tech), there’s no more dreams. Because the only path is ITE. It’s a dead end. So most of us give up our dreams.”
>
>While that is a generalisation, Kim says if you asked anyone at any stage of that, they would tell you they feel the inferiority, the gloom and the overall death of their childhood hopes and dreams.
>


### 4. Opportunities are hard to come by, even for the deserving.
*Those who didn't do a good job, never get to do a good job.*
>
>Filled with optimism, Kim applied for 10 jobs — chiefly positions in factories and warehouses as packers or various other labour work — wielding a special recommendation letter from the Yellow Ribbon Project, only to be laughed in his face.
>
> “What if you beat my men? What if you recruit them?” he recalls being mockingly asked. 
> #### Sadly, this drove him back to his gang...
> roughly a year later, he was sentenced to his second term of jail for drug consumption.
>

---
>
>“Most of these guys who come out from jail are offered jobs that pay maybe $600 a month. Like cleaning fast food restaurant cooker hoods at 3am. One particular case sticks in my mind: The guy couldn't even get to the job because there's no bus that takes him there at the time, so he ends up going there before midnight to wait for hours to do this horrendous job, the only one he could get.
>
> #### How is that going to keep him out of jail? I just couldn't see the logic.
> The first thing he does is he quits the job and goes back to his gang. A few months later, he's back in jail. You want to keep these guys out of jail, you have to create more and better options.”
>

#### What can one change?
The problems we face on the road ahead are daunting. But we should take heart — indeed, we must — because many like us are hard at work, producing a reason to hope.

### 1. Education and training can still open up new pathways in life.
>
>He took one year to prepare for his O levels and his results surpassed his expectations: four A1s and a credit.
>
>"I guess my mindset was very different then. My classmates and I were very motivated. There was no distraction; the prison is actually a very good place to study," he quips.
>
>Prison school changed his life in more ways than one.
>
> #### "Education really broadened my perspectives. For the first time, I felt that my options were not limited. I felt I could do other things, things which are more meaningful."


### 2. People are interacting in our common spaces, and they're working together for a common good.
>
>Even while in school, Kim volunteered and gave back what he was receiving — he helped residents write appeal letters at DPM Tharman’s Meet-the-People Sessions in Taman Jurong, still living in Boon Lay at the time, and on Tharman’s prompting, got together a few fellow ex-inmates like lawyer Darren Tan and started an initiative they called “Beacon of Life”.
>
> #### Under the programme, Kim and Tan would seek out boys playing football at the void decks of HDB blocks — whom residents also reported had been abusing drugs — and befriend them. 
> They played football with them, brought in an S.League player to train them properly, and also harnessed their own personal skills and pulled in friends to give them free tuition or lessons in numerous different skills.
>

### 3. The right support, from the right people, still re-ignites our dreams.
>
>Kim had completed a NITEC in electrical engineering, but remained uninspired while still in prison so he joined a pottery class — suddenly, his childhood dream of being an artist sparked a newfound clarity of purpose for him.
>
>“I was really depressed when I was in NITEC. Even if you go to poly, after that you come out, you’re a technician or an engineer.
>
> #### I always say if I never met (Chen), it’s either I’ll become a factory worker or go back to the gang. 
> It’s so important to meet the right people. Even if I met other artists, I’m not sure things would have turned out the same way. Not many people can tolerate ex-offenders.”
>

### 4. Many of us still believe in making opportunities accessible.

>Mr Kim Whye Kee, 34, an ex-gang leader who spent 10 years behind bars for drug and gang activities, who has since graduated with second upper honours from Lasalle College of the Arts.
>
> #### Mr Kim relates how Mr Chan personally drove him to get art materials for school, made him dinner during term time, and even paid for his fees when his bursary fell through. 
> "He is like a father to me. I was someone who didn't dare to dream of a future, but I met this man who not only taught me to dare to dream but who also walked with me throughout the journey to realise my dream," says Mr Kim, who now works for Mr Chan as a product designer and followed in his footsteps to become a grassroots volunteer in Taman Jurong.

These people's stories point to ways for our society, and for our systems, to move forward. Besides BOLA, other groups are changing what they can, too. Here at Hatch, we select, train and place deserving but disadvantaged youths into high-potential startups. (If you're interested in what we do, [reach out to us](/contact/))

So, fortunately, things can be a lot better.

Now: what will you change?
