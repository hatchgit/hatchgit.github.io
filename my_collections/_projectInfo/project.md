### What we do

Hatch provides at-risk youths with effective training and job matching services by working closely with our industry partners. 


### Who it's for

Our pilot programme is open to at-risk youths, ideally aged 18-25, who are driven and possess a strong interest in the IT or design industry.

We also seek collaborations with companies who are looking to hire interns or junior staff, and are keen to consider our UI/UX-trained youths.    





### Focus areas

Hatch is capitalizing on recent developments in the digital sector due to:
- steady growth in demand for skilled tech workers providing good career prospects, as validated by professionals and hiring managers in the sector
- interest in joining tech-related sectors from at-risk youths, as validated by program coordinators and youth workers
- several partner companies who have agreed to hire these youths upon completion of our training program


#### Specific sector: UI/UX and Web Design

UI focuses on the interactivity and presentation of a product while UX focuses on optimising a product for pleasant and efficient use.

The jobs in these areas are less narrowly technical and entering the industry depends more on one's design skills than academic qualifications. They require a more generalist skill set which is easier to start picking up, and is complemented by some technical knowledge that is applied to the development of technical products. Thus, the barriers to entry into these jobs are relatively low and the skills required are also transferable and have lasting value.


### Costs and fees

All course fees will be paid for through our funding with NYC, so there is no cost incurred for participating youth.

### Programme features
#### For Youths

Being a participant of the Hatch programme gives you a platform to pursue a meaningful career and be developed both in terms of skills and personal growth.

Through the course of training, you will develop a portfolio of work which you can then present to prospective employers, thus showcasing your strengths and skills.

Upon successful completion of training, you will be placed for an internship with one of our partner companies. A company employee will mentor you as you go through on-job training while working during your employment. The internship gives you valuable work experience should you continue to pursue this line of work.


#### For Employers

Partner firms stand to gain a new, untapped source of potential young talent.

Through our customised training programme for the youths, deisgned with partner firms' input, we ensure that our participating youths receive quality training that meets industry needs. Upon completing the training workshops, youths would have developed a portfolio of work, which validates the youthâ€™s competence in meeting the company's hiring requirements.

Our pool of trained and motivated youths can also serve as a source of sustainability for companies. These youths are potential long-term employees, and through mentoring and close interaction, employers can find the right fit for various roles in their companies. This not only gives youths a chance to contribute meaningfully to the company in a way he/she enjoys, but could also help lower employee turnover.
