### What we do

Hatch provides youths/YARs with effective training and job matching services by working closely with our industry partners. 


### Focus areas

Hatch is capitalizing on recent developments in the digital sector because:
- there is a steady growth in demand for skilled tech workers providing good career prospects, as validated by professionals and hiring managers in the sector
- have with us several partner companies who have agreed to hire these youths upon completion of our training program
- a sizeable portion of youths have interest in joining tech-related sectors even though they may not know how they do so, as validated by program coordinators and youth workers


#### Specific sectors: UI/UX and Web Design

UI focuses on the interactivity and presentation of a product while UX focuses on optimising a product for pleasant and efficient use.

The jobs in these areas are less narrowly technical and does not require high levels of  programming competency or being fluent in various programming languages. They require a more generalist skill set which is easier to pick up, and is complemented by some technical knowledge that is applied to the development of technical products. Thus, the barriers to entry into these jobs are relatively low and the skills required are also transferable and have lasting value.


### How it'll work

Hatch will be investing in developing participants through the management and facilitation of the Hatch programme. Our pilot programme is open to youths/YARs who are driven and possess a strong interest in the IT or design industry. All costs for the pilot will be paid for through our funding with NYC, so there is no cost incurred on the youth.


### Who we work with and why join us

#### For Youths

Being a participant of the Hatch programme gives you a platform to pursue a meaningful career and be developed both in terms of skills and personal growth.

Our customised training workshops that relates practical skills to theoretical aspects ensures that participants receive quality training that meets the needs and demands of the industry that they are entering and compensates for any lack of formal education or qualification. Lessons are limited to 4 hours a day for shorter intervals of sustained focus and optimal learning conditions. Throughout the training workshops, you will develop a portfolio of work which you can then present to prospective employers, thus showcasing your strengths and skills.

The on-the-job training, which comprise of being mentored by a company employee, upon completion of the training workshops provides an environment that creates opportunities, tangible takeaways and guidance through a first hand experience of what it is like to work with SMEs/start-ups.

You will thus have an increased access to opportunities for being exposed to various industries, which would not have been possible without relevant qualifications.

Through our programme, you will also have the opportunity to understand yourself better through the experience and develop greater self-awareness about their life choices.

#### For Employers and Firms

Our partner employers/companies/SMEs/start-ups provide on-the-job training for youths/YARs. This provides an environment that creates opportunities, tangible takeaways and guidance for our youths through a first hand experience of what it is like to work with SMEs/start-ups. To ease the youth’s transition into the company, he/she will be placed under the mentorship of a company employee. Thereafter, Hatch will work closely with our partner employers/companies/SMEs/start-ups to see if there are any gaps we need to address.

Through our customised training programme for the youths/YARs jointly designed by our partner companies and trainers, we ensure that they receive quality training that meets the needs and demands of the industry that they are entering. Companies are ensured that the youths will be equipped with skills that they expect of in their employees. Upon completing the training workshops, youths/YARs will develop a portfolio of work, which validates the youth’s competence in meeting the company's hiring requirements.

Our pool of trained and motivated youths can also serve as a source of sustainability for companies. By having the opportunity to closely interact with youths that they may potentially become long term employees, employers can find the right fit for various roles in their companies. Not only does this give youths a chance to contribute meaningfully to the company in a way he/she enjoys, it may potentially lower the employee turnover rate.

#### For Trainers

The training workshops are designed to focus greatly on practical skills, like creating wireframes of designs, which are taught alongside theoretical aspects of UI/UX design, as professional designers have reflected the importance of being able to sketch ideas up in the early stages of one’s professional career. The training workshops will also be jointly designed with the employers to ensure that youths/YARs receive quality training that meets the needs and demands of the industry that they are entering. The training workshops will then be facilitated by our partner trainers.
